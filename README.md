# All-Strings-Attached
Senior Design Project under Dr. Abbott

Sponsership: Phil Westhart

### Team Members
Fall 2021 - Spring 2022: Carlos Rosales-Moran, Kimberly Tse, Joshua Webb

## Objective
**End Goal:** 
Determine the lifespan of strings on a string instrument
- First Iteration (Fall 2021-Spring 2022): Data Collection, provide foundation of mobile applicaiton

## Resources
**Mobile Application**
- ReactNative
- Expo Simulator (for debugging purposes)

**Microcontroller Programming**
- ArduinoIDE
- Special thanks to Neil Kolban for providing BLE libraries for the ESP32: Check out his repository: https://github.com/nkolban

## How to Use
Have the following in hand - we'll provide the documentation of how to set up
- Firebeetle IoT ESP32
- Wires & solder
- Wire stripper/cutter
- Pliers
- Proto-boards (optional)
- Tilt sensors
- AllStringsAttached mobile application

**Microcontroller SOFTWARE**
1. Download "All_Code_Put_Togehter.ino" into your desired directory. Make sure that it is nested underneath the folder with the same name.
2. Open the program using Arduino IDE
3. Compile & run :)

**Microcontroller HARDWARE**
1. Refer to the circuit schematic uploaded into this repo
2. Make sure to test each wiring when you solder. You can use a circuitboard to see whether it works!
3. Follow the circuit schematic and put the components together

**Microcontroller and Mobile Application **
1. Use the BLE scanner to check for the "Strings attached" device
2. Have fun!

## Future Implementation
- Update GUI of mobile application
- Collect data & attributes
- Develop string life prediction algorithm

## Acknowledgements
We would like to extend our deepest gratitude to those who have mentored, inspired, and/or guided us throughout this year-long project. We would like to first thank Dr. Rezaie for their mentorship and advice throughout the year, engineering technician Mr. Vernon Weir and Ms. Nicole Webb, and administrative coordinator Ms. Gail Jaszcz for helping us with the materials and operations of building our prototypes. We would also like to thank Mr. Don Bustos and Mr. Kevin Mendoza for their donation of strings.

Our deepest thanks to our customer, Phil Westhart, for providing the opportunity of implementing this project and for sharing his knowledge, guidance, and funding. Similarly, we would like to thank our mentor, Dr. Abbott, for guiding us throughout the projectâ€™s lifespan and for sharing the knowledge he has gained through several years of industry experience. Finally, we would like to thank all the other professors, students, and everyone that have shared their invaluable knowledge with us, since without them, we would not have sufficient knowledge to undergo this project.
