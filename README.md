# All-Strings-Attached
Senior Project under Dr. Abbott and with sponsership of Phil Westhart

### Team Members
Carlos Rosales-Moran, Kimberly Tse, Joshua Webb

## Objective
...
## How to Use
Have the following in hand - we'll provide the documentation of how to set up
- Firebeetle IoT ESP32
- Wires & solder
- Wire stripper/cutter
- Pliers
- Proto-boards (optional)
- Tilt sensors
- AllStringsAttached mobile application
**Microcontroller SOFTWARE**
1. Download "All_Code_Put_Togehter.ino" into your desired directory. Make sure that it is nested underneath the folder with the same name.
2. Open the program using Arduino IDE
3. Compile & run :)

**Microcontroller HARDWARE**
1. Refer to the circuit schematic uploaded into this repo
2. Make sure to test each wiring when you solder. You can use a circuitboard to see whether it works!
3. Follow the circuit schematic and put the components together

**Microcontroller and Mobile Application **
1. Use the BLE scanner to check for the "Strings attached" device
2. Have fun!

## Future Implementation
- Update GUI of mobile application
- Collect data & attributes
- Develop string life prediction algorithm
